# House Price Prediction

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is "House_Price.csv". It contains information about houses and whether they are sold or not.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to predict whether a house is sold or not using two different approaches:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

## Steps
1. **Data Loading:** Load the dataset "House_Price.csv".
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, encode categorical variables if any, and split the data into training and testing sets.
3. **Logistic Regression:**
   - Train a logistic regression model on the training data.
   - Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data.
4. **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN):**
   - Design an ANN architecture suitable for binary classification.
   - Train the ANN model on the training data.
   - Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data.
5. **Comparison:** Compare the performance of logistic regression and ANN models.
6. **Conclusion:** Summarize findings and insights from the analysis.
